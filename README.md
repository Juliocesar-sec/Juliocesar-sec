## 👋 About Me
[Brief introduction]

I'm a multidisciplinary learner exploring the intersection of **social engineering**, **psychoanalysis**, and **cybersecurity**.
With a foundation in **psychoanalytic theory** and growing expertise in **ethical hacking**, I focus on how psychological dynamics influence digital security. My interests include:

- 🧠 Human-centered security
- 🕵️‍♂️ Social engineering techniques
- 🧩 Trust, manipulation, and behavior in cyber contexts

I aim to develop tools and insights that integrate human psychology with cybersecurity practices.

## 🎯 Objectives

I'm currently focused on deepening my knowledge in **psychoanalysis** and **cybersecurity**, with a special interest in how human behavior shapes digital threats.
My main goal is to **join a Security Operations Center (SOC)**, where I can contribute to threat detection and response while continuing to explore the psychological side of cyber defense.
