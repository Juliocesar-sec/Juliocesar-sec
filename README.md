## 👋 About Me
[Brief introduction]

I am a professional driven by a passion for technology and a deep interest in human behavior. My journey combines software development, cybersecurity, psychoanalysis, and philosophy — an integration that allows me to view technical solutions through a more strategic, empathetic, and comprehensive lens.

As a developer, I work on creating intuitive interfaces and robust architectures, always focusing on security and user experience. I constantly seek to improve my skills in both front-end and back-end development, aiming to build systems that are not only functional but also resilient to digital threats.

My growing specialization in cybersecurity reflects my commitment to protecting data and systems. I stay up-to-date with the evolving digital landscape, applying best practices, conducting vulnerability assessments, and developing preventive solutions to ensure information integrity.

Psychoanalysis complements this work by offering a deeper understanding of human patterns — something essential for predicting user behavior and anticipating attacker strategies. This approach enables me to combine information security with behavioral analysis, resulting in more effective, human-centered, and strategic solutions.

I value continuous learning, ethics, communication, and collaborative work. I believe that personal development is not an isolated process, but rather a joint construction with other professionals. That’s why I’m always open to feedback, new ideas, and constant improvement, with the goal of contributing to safer and more trustworthy digital environments. 
I aim to develop tools and insights that integrate human psychology with cybersecurity practices.

## 🎯 Objectives

I'm currently focused on deepening my knowledge in **psychoanalysis** and **cybersecurity**, with a special interest in how human behavior shapes digital threats.
My main goal is to **join a Security Operations Center (SOC)**, where I can contribute to threat detection and response while continuing to explore the psychological side of cyber defense.
